# Implementation Quick Reference

This document provides a quick reference for implementing the recommended README improvements.

## Priority 1: Add Emojis to Note Sections (5 minutes)

### Changes Required: 4 simple edits

#### Line 28: Informational Note
```diff
-> **Note:** Python 3.12+ introduced native eager task execution via `asyncio.eager_task_factory`. See [docs/eager_tasks.md](docs/eager_tasks.md) for a detailed comparison of Python's built-in eager tasks and asynkit's `eager()` feature.

#### Line 677: Deprecation Warning
```diff
-> **Note:** Event loop policies are deprecated as of Python 3.14 and will be removed in Python 3.16.

```

#### Line 712: Experimental Feature
```diff
-> **Note:** This is currently an __experimental__ feature.
+> 🧪 **Note:** This is currently an experimental feature.
```

Note: Also remove the `__experimental__` formatting (double underscores) since the emoji now provides the emphasis.

#### Line 913: Platform Limitation Warning
```diff
-> **Note:** Task interruption with `_PyTask` objects does not work on Python 3.14.0 due to a bug
+> ⚠️ **Note:** Task interruption with `_PyTask` objects does not work on Python 3.14.0 due to a bug
```

### Impact
- ✅ Improves scannability
- ✅ No structural changes
- ✅ Preserves all existing content
- ✅ Low risk, high impact

---

## Priority 2: Add Key Features Section (30 minutes)

### Location: After installation section, before "Coroutine Tools"

Insert between line 22 (after closing of installation code block) and line 24 (before "## Coroutine Tools"):

```markdown
## Key Features

- 🚀 **[Eager Execution](#eager)**: Start coroutines immediately, not when awaited
- ⚡ **[Advanced Scheduling](#scheduling-tools)**: Priority tasks, queue control, task switching  
- 🔧 **[Coroutine Control](#coroutine-tools)**: Low-level inspection and manipulation
- 🔬 **[Experimental Features](#experimental-features)**: Task interruption, custom timeouts
- 🔌 **Backend Support**: Full `asyncio` and `anyio` support, limited `trio` support

```

### Impact
- ✅ Provides quick overview
- ✅ Improves navigation
- ✅ Helps first-time visitors
- ⚠️ Makes README slightly longer

---

## Priority 3: Improve Opening Description (10 minutes)

### Current (line 5-6):
```markdown
This module provides some handy tools for those wishing to have better control over the
way Python's `asyncio` module does things.
```

### Recommended:
```markdown
**asynkit** provides advanced control over Python's `asyncio` module, offering tools for 
eager execution, fine-grained scheduling, and powerful coroutine manipulation.
```

### Alternative (more concise):
```markdown
**asynkit** gives you advanced control over Python's `asyncio` through eager execution, 
fine-grained scheduling, and low-level coroutine manipulation.
```

### Impact
- ✅ More specific about capabilities
- ✅ Uses stronger, more confident language
- ✅ Better keyword density for searches
- ⚠️ Slightly more opinionated

---

## Priority 4: Add Table of Contents (15 minutes)

### Location: After Key Features section (if added) or after installation

```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Coroutine Tools](#coroutine-tools)
  - [Eager Execution](#eager)
  - [Running Async from Sync](#await_sync-aiter_sync)
  - [CoroStart](#corostart)
  - [Monitor & Generators](#monitors-and-generators)
  - [Coroutine Helpers](#coroutine-helpers)
- [Scheduling Tools](#scheduling-tools)
- [Priority Scheduling](#priority-scheduling)
- [anyio Support](#anyio-support)
- [Experimental Features](#experimental-features)
```

### Impact
- ✅ Improves navigation for long README
- ✅ Helps users find specific features
- ✅ Standard practice for large READMEs
- ⚠️ Requires maintenance as sections change

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (15 minutes total)
1. Add emojis to Note sections (5 min)
2. Improve opening description (10 min)

### Phase 2: Structure Improvements (45 minutes total)  
3. Add Key Features section (30 min)
4. Add Table of Contents (15 min)

### Phase 3: Testing
- Verify all internal links work
- Check rendering on GitHub
- Review on mobile view
- Ensure no markdown syntax errors

---

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check markdown syntax
uv run mdformat --check README.md

# Format if needed
uv run mdformat README.md
```

---

## Rollback Plan

All changes are additive or cosmetic. To rollback:
- Emoji changes: Simply remove the emoji character
- New sections: Delete the added section
- Description change: Revert to original text

No risk to existing content or links.

---

## Questions to Answer Before Implementation

1. **Emoji style**: Do you want to use emojis? (Recommendation: YES)
2. **Key Features**: Do you want the feature summary section? (Recommendation: YES)  
3. **TOC**: Do you want a table of contents? (Recommendation: YES for READMEs > 500 lines)
4. **Description**: Do you want to strengthen the opening? (Recommendation: YES)

---

## Just Do It: Minimal Implementation

If you want the absolute minimum impactful change:

**Just add emojis to the 4 Note sections** (5 minutes, high impact)

That's it. The single highest-impact change you can make with minimal effort.
