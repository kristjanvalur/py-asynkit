# README Restructuring Recommendations

## Current Structure Analysis

The current README follows this pattern:
1. Title and badges
2. Brief description
3. Bullet list of all features (mixed detail levels)
4. Installation
5. Deep dive into each feature section

### Strengths
- Comprehensive coverage of all features
- Good code examples
- Clear technical documentation

### Areas for Improvement
- Feature list at top is lengthy and varied in abstraction level
- Main features aren't immediately visually distinct from utilities
- Structure makes it harder to identify what the library is **primarily** about

## Recommendation 1: Restructure with "Features First" Approach

### Proposed New Structure

```markdown
# asynkit: A toolkit for Python coroutines

[badges]

**asynkit** provides advanced control over Python's asyncio module, offering tools for eager execution, fine-grained scheduling, and powerful coroutine manipulation.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Eager Execution
Lower latency by starting coroutines immediately, not when awaited
- [`eager()`](#eager) decorator and converter
- Compatible with Python 3.10+, complements Python 3.12+ built-in eager tasks
- [Learn more](#eager-execution-details)

### ⚡ Advanced Task Scheduling  
Fine-grained control over task execution order
- Priority scheduling with [`PriorityTask`](#priority-scheduling)
- Queue position control with [`sleep_insert()`](#sleep_insert), [`task_switch()`](#task_switch)
- [Learn more](#scheduling-tools)

### 🔧 Coroutine Control Tools
Low-level coroutine manipulation and introspection
- [`CoroStart`](#corostart) - Start and inspect coroutines
- [`Monitor`](#monitor) - Out-of-band communication with coroutines
- [`await_sync()`](#await_sync) - Run async code synchronously when possible
- [Learn more](#coroutine-tools)

### 🔬 Experimental Features
Cutting-edge capabilities (platform-dependent)
- Task interruption with [`task_interrupt()`](#task_interrupt)
- Custom timeouts
- [Learn more](#experimental-features)

### 🔌 Backend Support
- ✅ Full support for `asyncio`
- ✅ `anyio` support with `asyncio` backend
- ⚠️ Limited `trio` backend support

## Quick Start

[installation and basic example]

## Documentation

[Detailed sections follow...]
```

### Why This Works Better

1. **Visual hierarchy**: Emojis and clear categories make scanning easier
2. **Feature prioritization**: Key features stand out immediately
3. **User journey**: Goes from "what can I do" → "how do I start" → "detailed docs"
4. **Quick decision making**: Readers can quickly assess if the library fits their needs

## Recommendation 2: API Classes in Headlines (Backticks)

### Answer: Yes, it's appropriate and widely used

#### Examples from Popular Python Libraries

**httpx** (by Tom Christie, creator of Django REST Framework):
```markdown
### The `Client` class
### `Response` objects  
### `httpx.AsyncClient`
```

**attrs** (popular Python library):
```markdown
### `@attr.s` and `@attr.ib`
### `validators` and `converters`
```

**pydantic**:
```markdown
### `BaseModel`
### `Field` objects
```

**rich** (terminal formatting):
```markdown
### `Console` class
### `Table` objects
```

### Best Practices for Using Backticks in Headers

✅ **DO use backticks for:**
- Class names: `CoroStart`, `Monitor`, `PriorityTask`
- Function/method names: `eager()`, `await_sync()`, `task_interrupt()`
- Module names: `asynkit.experimental.priority`
- Technical terms that are code entities: `asyncio.Task`

✅ **DO combine with descriptive text:**
- `eager()` - lower latency IO ✅ (current style is good)
- `CoroStart` - Manual coroutine control ✅
- `Monitor` - Out-of-band coroutine communication ✅

❌ **DON'T use for:**
- General concepts: Scheduling (not `Scheduling`)
- Non-code terms: Installation, Quick Start

### Current Status
Your README **already follows best practices** with backticks. Examples:
- `### eager() - lower latency IO` ✅
- `### CoroStart` ✅  
- `### await_sync(), aiter_sync() - Running coroutines synchronously` ✅

**Recommendation**: Keep current usage, it's excellent.

## Recommendation 3: Emojis in Note Sections

### Answer: Yes, strategic emoji use improves readability

#### Types of Notes and Suggested Emojis

**Informational notes** (FYI, comparisons, alternatives):
```markdown
ℹ️ **Note:** Python 3.12+ introduced native eager task execution...
```
or
```markdown
💡 **Note:** Python 3.12+ introduced native eager task execution...
```

**Warning/Caution notes** (limitations, gotchas):
```markdown
⚠️ **Note:** Task interruption with `_PyTask` objects does not work on Python 3.14.0...
```

**Experimental/Beta features**:
```markdown
🧪 **Note:** This is currently an experimental feature.
```

**Deprecated features**:
```markdown
⚠️ **Note:** Event loop policies are deprecated as of Python 3.14...
```

**Platform-specific notes**:
```markdown
🖥️ **Note:** This feature works only on Linux and macOS.
```

#### Examples from Popular Projects

**FastAPI** (by Sebastián Ramírez):
```markdown
✅ Full support  
⚠️ Warning  
💡 Tip
ℹ️ Info
```

**Pydantic V2**:
Uses emojis liberally for notes, warnings, and tips in documentation.

**Python's own documentation** (recent additions):
Starting to use emojis in tables and compatibility matrices (as you already do!)

#### Implementation for Your README

**Current:**
```markdown
> **Note:** Python 3.12+ introduced native eager task execution...
```

**Recommended:**
```markdown
> ℹ️ **Note:** Python 3.12+ introduced native eager task execution via `asyncio.eager_task_factory`. 
> See [docs/eager_tasks.md](docs/eager_tasks.md) for a detailed comparison.
```

**Current:**
```markdown
> **Note:** This is currently an __experimental__ feature.
```

**Recommended:**
```markdown
> 🧪 **Note:** This is currently an experimental feature.
```

**Current:**
```markdown
> **Note:** Event loop policies are deprecated as of Python 3.14...
```

**Recommended:**
```markdown
> ⚠️ **Note:** Event loop policies are deprecated as of Python 3.14 and will be removed in Python 3.16.
```

**Current:**
```markdown
> **Note:** Task interruption with `_PyTask` objects does not work on Python 3.14.0...
```

**Recommended:**
```markdown
> ⚠️ **Note:** Task interruption with `_PyTask` objects does not work on Python 3.14.0 due to a bug
> in `asyncio.current_task()` that prevents it from recognizing tasks created by custom task factories.
```

### Emoji Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use emojis consistently (same emoji for same type of note)
- Keep it professional (avoid playful emojis in technical docs)
- Use standard, widely-recognized emojis
- Place emoji at the start of the note type: `ℹ️ **Note:**`

**DON'T:**
- Overuse emojis (only for notes, warnings, feature highlights)
- Use ambiguous emojis
- Mix emoji styles (stick to one set)

### Recommended Emoji Palette for asynkit

- ℹ️ Informational notes
- 💡 Tips and best practices  
- ⚠️ Warnings and limitations
- 🧪 Experimental features
- 🚀 Performance/speed features (in headers)
- ⚡ Low-latency/immediate execution (in headers)
- 🔧 Control/configuration tools (in headers)
- 🔬 Advanced/low-level features (in headers)
- ✅ Supported feature (in tables)
- ❌ Unsupported feature (in tables)

## Summary of Recommendations

### 1. Structure Changes
- **Add a "Key Features" section** near the top with visual hierarchy
- **Use emojis** to categorize features (🚀 Performance, ⚡ Scheduling, 🔧 Control)
- **Group features by use case** rather than implementation detail
- **Keep detailed sections** but make them easier to navigate to

### 2. Backticks in Headlines
- ✅ **Current usage is correct** - keep using backticks for API classes and functions
- ✅ **Industry standard** - widely used by popular Python libraries
- ℹ️ **No changes needed** to current practice

### 3. Emojis in Notes
- ✅ **Add emojis** to Note sections for better visual scanning
- ✅ **Use consistently**: ℹ️ for info, ⚠️ for warnings, 🧪 for experimental
- ✅ **Professional and purposeful** - matches style of modern Python documentation

## Implementation Priority

1. **High priority**: Add emojis to Note sections (quick win, improves readability)
2. **Medium priority**: Add "Key Features" section at top (helps first-time visitors)
3. **Low priority**: Consider reorganizing detailed sections (current structure is functional)

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Implement the emoji additions to Note sections?
2. Create a new "Key Features" section at the top of the README?
3. Both of the above?
4. Something else?

I can make these changes while preserving all existing content and maintaining the current professional tone.
